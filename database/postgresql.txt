to create a database:

1- create the database using pgAdmin

1.2- add getdate function:

database/cairo/CSScript/postgresql/functions/getdate.sql

2- before run the create tables scripts set the time zone

ALTER DATABASE {database name} SET timezone TO 'UTC';

3- run the scripts in:

database/cairo/CSScript/postgresql/tables/cairo_script.sql

run all functions and sequences (yes one by one ( O O )
                                                   d
                                                  ^^^

was a joke you don't have to do one by one :P

just run this (

SELECT pg_get_functiondef(f.oid)
FROM pg_catalog.pg_proc f
INNER JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON (f.pronamespace = n.oid)
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'

) in pgadmin and export to a file. use option "Query > Execute to a file".

no ready yet. we need to change "\n with ;\n and remove the first line of the file.

now we have to run unaccent
then debugger
finally this file we have created with pgadmin.

so

1) /database/cairo/CSScript/postgresql/postgresql_system_functions/9.0/unaccent.sql
2) /Work/CrowSoft/postgresql/scripts/debugger/pldbgapi--1.0.sql
3) run your file

very good explanation about time zone
