to create a database:

1- create the database using pgAdmin

2- before run the create tables scripts set the time zone

ALTER DATABASE {database name} SET timezone TO 'UTC';

3- run the scripts in:

database/cairo/CSScript/postgresql/tables/cairo_script.sql

4- run the file all_functions.sql

run all functions and sequences (yes one by one ( O O )
                                                   d
                                                  ^^^

that was a joke you don't have to do one by one :P



just run this in pgadmin and export to a file. use option "Query > Execute to a file".

no ready yet. we need to change "\n with ;\n and remove the first line of the file.

now we have to run unaccent
then debugger
finally this file we have created with pgadmin.

so

1) /database/cairo/CSScript/postgresql/postgresql_system_functions/9.0/unaccent.sql
2) /Work/CrowSoft/postgresql/scripts/debugger/pldbgapi--1.0.sql
3) run your file

very good explanation about time zone
