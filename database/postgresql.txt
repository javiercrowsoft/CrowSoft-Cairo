to create a database:

1- create the database using pgAdmin

2- before run the create tables scripts set the time zone

ALTER DATABASE {database name} SET timezone TO 'UTC';

3- run the scripts in:

database/cairo/CSScript/postgresql/tables/cairo_script.sql

4- run the file all_functions.sql

run all functions and sequences (yes one by one ( O O )
                                                   d
                                                  ^^^

that was a joke you don't have to do one by one :P

just run this in pgadmin and export to a file. use option "Query > Execute to a file".

SELECT pg_get_functiondef(f.oid)
FROM pg_catalog.pg_proc f
INNER JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON (f.pronamespace = n.oid)
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'

--

no ready yet. we need to change "$function$ with $function$;" and then "AS $function$; with AS $function$" (be carefull with the order)
and finally remove the first line of the file (it contains the name of the column for the select we used to create the file).

now we have to run unaccent
then debugger

changes to the file we created with all functions
-------------------------------------------------

then open the file and serch for pldbg_ and delete all debugger functions
then at the end of the file you will find unaccent. you need to delete them too.
finally run the file we have created with pgadmin.

so

1) /database/cairo/CSScript/postgresql/postgresql_system_functions/9.0/unaccent.sql
2) /Work/CrowSoft/postgresql/scripts/debugger/pldbgapi--1.0.sql
3) run your file

very good explanation about time zone
